== Question

== Comics

== What the future needs?

You know what the future needs?

TIP: It needs new stories and it needs *you* to make them.

== Pigeon Net

== T.V.

With all the reality shows I think TV is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

TIP: Write a comicbook that is a sitcom.
Think of each 22 page comic book like a 22 minute episode of a sitcom.

== Hollywood

Look at all the movies made from comic books right now!

== Great heros like Superman and Tarzan... 

* How many more remakes of Tarzan is Hollywood going to make?
* Hollywood is scraping the bottom of the barrel too.
* They seem to be out of ideas.

== Original Characters

TIP: Create your own original characters. 
The world needs new characters.

== Tools

You need a pencil (or maybe just your phone)

* Writer? Composition notebook
* Artist? Sketchbook

TIP: Make marks in them *everyday*!

== Quote: Jake Parker

icon:quote-left[2x, role=maroon]  _Fill up a sketchbook every month._

== Everyday

TIP: Get in a habit of writing or sketching everyday.

== Using a Sketchbook

TIP: Draw on one side so ink doesn't ruin art on back.



== No Standard Script Format

TIP: Here's my easy format for writing a full script

pg #1

* panel 1 - we see two people going up a hill.
** Jack: Did you hear that?
** Jill: What was it?
* panel 2
* panel 3

== Quote: Brian Michael Bendis 

icon:quote-left[2x, role=maroon]  _95% of the artists he works with want a 'full script'._


== TIP: One action per panel

== Quote: Frank Miller 

icon:quote-left[2x, role=maroon]  _Describe what we are looking at._

e.g. panel 1 - *We see* a tiny toad leaping off a mushroom into a bed of soft moss.

TIP: "Show don't tell".
Like writing a movie script.



== Quote: Kurt Busiek 

icon:quote-left[2x, role=maroon]  _Ask the artist for a wish list of what they want to draw. It's a collaboration._

== Snoopy fired from MetLife

After 31 years at MetLife.



== Quote: Brian Michael Bendis 

icon:quote-left[2x, role=maroon]  _Write for one person: your artist._

_If you don't have an artist already, pick one you like and really study their work._

_Look how much room Will Eisner leaves for dialog. 
Look how he does expressions._

_Maybe the artist will do such a great job with an expression that you can remove the dialog.
The picture says it all._


== Writing Class at PCC Portland

TIP: Brian Michael Bendis and David F. Walker are teaching a class on writing comics at PCC in Portland.





== Quote: Terry Moore 

icon:quote-left[2x, role=maroon]  _It's a people business._

TIP: Learn to collaborate
