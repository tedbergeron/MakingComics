== Make a Comic Strip

A one hour class on making comic strips

with Ted Bergeron

== Overview

We'll cover how to make a comic strip in three steps.

. Story
. Art
. Sharing 


== Intro

What is your favorite comic strip?


== Parts of a Comic Strip

* Panels
* Word Balloons
* Characters


== Step 1: Story

Before you start any art, you need the story.

* Theme of your comic strip
** Pick a setting and characters
* Genre: Comedy, SciFi...

TIP: Not a writer? Collaborate with one.

== Writing Daily Comic Strip

For example, let's focus on a funny comic strip.

* Gag comic is most popular
* Typically 3-4 panels
* Get to the punchline
 

== Story Start

Use two characters to talk to each other.

_Why did the chicken cross the road?_

What could you do to make this funny?
 
== Punchline

To get away from the chicken taco stand.

== Check Yourself

*Is it funny?*

* Try exaggerating


== The Story

. chicken crosses the road
* Dog says: Why did the chicken cross the road?
. we see a taco stand
* Armadillo says: Duh! and points right
. sign says: Special Chicken Tacos

 
== Step 2: Art

* Character Design
** What do the characters look like?
* Set Design
** What does the scene look like?

Sketch characters. Scout locations.


== Storyboards

* Make some quick thumbnail sketches of your story.
* Choosing the moment
** Close up, medium shot...
** Action shot. Best if characters are doing something.
** Funny reaction pose

== Format

Typically artists work at twice the printed size on Bristol board. 

* 13" x 4" for original art
** 4 panels each 3-1/4" wide 
** 3 panels each 26 picas wide
** 1/4" gutter size

NOTE: Find 11 x 14 or 11 x 17 at any craft or art store.

== Layout Paper

We will work at the printed size on copy paper.

Create an outline of the comic strip, drawing with a light touch.

* 9-3/4" wide (leave about 3/4" on each side)
* 3" tall

NOTE: Just use your best guess. It doesn't have to be perfect.

== Penciling

== Start with Words

* The top 1/3 is for your words
* The bottom 2/3 is for your art.

Typically the character that speaks first is on the left. Why?

* Pencil in the words first, very lightly
* Too many words? Go back to the writer

TIP: Use a lettering guide

== Word Balloons

* You want your words to fit nicely inside the balloons
* The balloon tail should point towards the character's mouth that is speaking

== Drawing Characters

* Expressions
* Pose: have your characters doing something.

== Inks

When you are done, make it darker.

* Heavier Pencil
* Ink
** permanent marker, brush or pen

WARNING: Make sure you ink doesn't bleed through and ruin the table. Use a clipboard or cardboard.

== Color?

* Water Colors
* Markers: Copic
* Colored Pencils


== Step 3: Sharing

* Sharing is the 21st century way to publish

== Social Media

What app do you use to share with friends and family?

* MySpace
* Friendster
* GeoCities

_(early turn of the century sites)_

== Snap or Scan

Just use your phone to take a picture and share it on Facebook or Twitter

TIP: You might want to get a flatbed scanner.

== Newspaper Syndication

King Features is one of the world's largest syndicates. 

* Cover letter with your contact info.
* 24 daily comic strips 
** Put 3 or 4 strips per page
* A character sheet

Physically mail them to NY, wait 8 - 12 weeks .
