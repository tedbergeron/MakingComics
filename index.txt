== Step 1: Story

Before you begin work on the art, you need the story.


== Theme and Genre

* Theme of your comic strip
* Pick a setting and characters
* Genre: Comedy, SciFi...

TIP: Not a writer? Collaborate with one.

== Writing Daily Comic Strip

For example, let's focus on a funny comic strip.

* Gag comic is most popular
* Typically 3-4 panels
* Get to the punchline
 
== Example Hoot 'N' Whoo

== Story Start

Use two characters to talk to each other.

_Why did the chicken cross the road?_

What could you do to make this funny?
 
== Punchline

To get away from the taco stand.

== Check Yourself

*Is it funny?*

* Try exaggerating


== The Story

. we see a chicken crossing the road
* Dog says: Why did the chicken cross the road?
. we see a taco stand
* Armadillo says: Duh! and points to the sign
. sign says: Special Chicken Tacos

 
== Step 2: Art

* Character Design: _What do your characters look like?_

Sketch characters

== Scenes

Set Design

_What does the scene look like?_

Scout locations.


== Storyboards

* Make some quick thumbnail sketches of your story.
* Choosing the moment
** Close up, medium shot...
** Action shot. Best if characters are doing something.
** Funny reaction pose

== Format

Typically artists work at twice the printed size on Bristol board. 

* 13" x 4" for original art
** 4 panels each 3-1/4" wide 
** 3 panels each 26 picas wide
** 1/4" gutter size

NOTE: Find 11 x 14 or 11 x 17 at any craft or art store.

== Layout Paper

We will work at 1-1/2 times the printed size on copy paper.

Create the container for the comic strip; draw lightly.

* 9-3/4" wide (leave about 3/4" on each side)
* 3" tall

Demo using your arm, pivot at elbow to draw straight lines

NOTE: Since we don't have a ruler, just use your best guess. It doesn't have to be perfect.


== Start with Words

* The top 1/3 is for your words
* The bottom 2/3 is for your art.

Typically the character that speaks first is on the left.

== Lettering

* Make your letters 1/8" high
* Leave 1/16" leading

TIP: Use a lettering guide

* Pencil in the words first, very lightly
* Too many words? Go back to the writer



== Word Balloons

Words should fit nicely inside the balloons. Balloon tail points towards the character's mouth

== Penciling

Refer to the thumbnails. Draw with a light touch. Get the foundation right, before adding details
